# Copying Your Project Folder to a USB Drive

To save a copy of your multimedia project, youâ€™ll need to copy your entire project folder to a USB drive or a Mac-formatted external hard drive. Note: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. will not work because cloud-based storage services cannot appear as connected drives on JAMS Lab or Campus Computer Lab Macs.

1. In a Finder window, navigate to your class folder. Then select your project folder. \(Note: Be sure to select the folder. Do not navigate to and select individual items inside your project folder.\)
2. Open another Finder window. Navigate to your USB drive or Mac-formatted external hard drive. 
3. Copy your project folder from your class folder to your USB drive or Mac-formatted external hard drive.
