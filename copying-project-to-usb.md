# Copying Your Project Folder to a USB Drive

To save a copy of your multimedia project, you’ll need to copy your entire project folder to a USB drive or a Windows-formatted external hard drive. **Note**: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. will not work because cloud-based storage services cannot appear as connected drives on JAMS Lab or Campus Computer Lab computers.

1. In an Explorer window, navigate to your class folder. Then select your project folder. \(**Note**: Be sure to select the folder. Do not navigate to and select individual items inside your project folder.\)
2. Open another Finder window. Navigate to your USB drive or Mac-formatted external hard drive. 
3. Copy your project folder from your class folder to your USB drive or Mac-formatted external hard drive.
