# File and Folder Naming Conventions

Occasionally, servers and multimedia programs run into problems when file and folder names contain spaces or special characters \(\#, ?, ", /, @, &, etc.\)

To avoid these problems, only use the following characters when naming files and folders:

* Lowercase letters \(a-z\)
* Numbers
* Hyphens \(to be used in place of spaces\)

## Example file name

`this-is-a-file.WAV`

Note: Don't change file extensions \(.WAV, .docx, .JPG, etc\).

## Example folder name

`folder-name`
