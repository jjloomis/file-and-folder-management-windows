# Navigating a Folder Tree in Explorer

Think of a folder tree as an upside down tree. The starting point of a drive \(like a **USB drive** or the **JAMS drive**\) is the root. To get to a specific folder in a drive, you may need to open a folder and then open another folder \(and so on.\) This process is called "drilling down" in a folder tree.

To go back up in the folder tree, you can use the **back** button in an Explorer window.

1. To navigate to your class folder, [open an Explorer window](opening-multiple-explorer-windows.md). Go to **This PC** \(on left.\) The root of the **JAMS drive** will appear as a connected device in the Explorer window.
2. You may need to drill down in the folder tree to navigate to where you need to be. Double-click a folder to drill down in the folder tree. The path \(sequence of folders\) to your class folder is:   `Courses\JAMS\Course-Number\Lastname-Firstname` 
3. To go up a level in the folder tree, use the **back** button in the Explorer window.
